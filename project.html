    <h1>Cleveland Cavaliers 2021-2022 Mid-season review.</h1>
    <p>The Cleveland Cavaliers has been the league's suprise team for now, completely changing the team's image from being a bottom-feeder team. These changes are definetly something done overnight as they have been building their team with young talent all along these years. Along these roster changes include drafting dynamic guards/swingmen in Collin Sexton, Darius Garland and Isaac Okoro, trading for froncourt depth in Jarett Allen and Lauri Markkanen, and drafting a talented bigman in Evan Mobley. The sucess of this Cavaliers team shouldn't be overlooked, thus here are my mid season grades for each player based on their performance.</p>

        <em>Cleveland Cavaliers guard Collin Sexton will miss the remainder of the season after undergoing surgery to repair a torn
        meniscus in his left knee, the team announced Friday. Sexton suffered the injury on Nov. 7 in a 126-109 victory over the
        New York Knicks, after which an MRI revealed the meniscus tear.</em>
        <p>As said, Collin is out for the season, which is an unfortunate circumstance that happen for the Cavs. Sexton, who averaged 24.3 points and 4.4 assists last season averaged just 16.0 points and 2 assists for the Cavs before his injury, this can be seen from Sexton having to share the ball with his new teamates, leading to his stats dropping, however the cavs still misses his shot-creating ability that he brring in every game and having to rely on third year point guard Darius Garland to carry the scoring load. Collin Sexton also has a contract extention to deal with this summer, while his injury might affect how much money he gets paid, i think that the cavs should try to bring him back as he is a very talented player and can help in various aspects of the team.</p>
